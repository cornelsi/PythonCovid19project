## Project Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across countries/regions
- Visualize trends with charts and maps
- Communicate findings through insights and summaries

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly (optional for choropleth maps)

## How to Run the Project
1. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
   ```
2. Place the 'owid-covid-data.csv' file in the same directory as this notebook.
3. Run all cells to generate the analysis and visualizations.

## Key Insights
1. The United States has the highest total cases among the selected countries, reflecting its large population.
2. The roll out of vaccinations in India is high as compared to the USA and Kenya.
3. Vaccination campaigns have significantly reduced the death rates over time, as seen in the flattening of the death curve.
4. The data highlights the importance of early vaccination to control mortality rates.
